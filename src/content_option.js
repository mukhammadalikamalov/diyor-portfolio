Currently, I'm diving deep into the world of web development while balancing my studies. My journey into coding began as a curious hobby and quickly transformed into a passionate pursuit.When I'm not writing code or debugging, you'll likely find me savoring a cup of coffee—my absolute favorite drink. Coffee isn't just a beverage for me; it's a ritual that fuels my creativity and keeps me energized throughout the day.Outside of the tech realm, I’m an avid fan of anime and manga. I'm always excited to take on new challenges and projects, so feel free to reach out if you want to chat about coding, coffee, or the latest anime!",
